Kaggle - Predict house prices with Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression and KNN

Data engineering:
i.   Removing features with low correlation.
ii.  Drop numerical features which mostly have a single value.
iii. Drop categorical features which mainly have 1 feature.
iv.  Merge long tail categories.
v.   Fill missing values.

Algorithms compare and analyze performance: 
i.   K nearest neighbors
ii.  K nearest neighbors with scaled values.
iii. Decision tree.
iv.	 Random Forest.
v.	 Lasso regression with scaled values.

Hyperparameters:
Look for the hyper parameters which have improve maximum performance.

Data preparation:
I tried different versions of data normalization and imputation.
